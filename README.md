# my-early-python-journey
This repo consists of all my early Python tasks. The tasks are about different topics from basics about variables to more advanced ones. I do these tasks while learning through the course in mohirdev.uz, e-learning platform, ( https://mohirdev.uz/kurslar/dasturlash-asoslari-python/ ).
