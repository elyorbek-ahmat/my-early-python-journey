# my-early-python-journey
mohir-python
This repo consists of all my early python tasks. The tasks are taken from different topics from basic topics about variables to more advanced ones. I do these tasks while learning through the course in mohirdev.uz e-learning platform ( https://mohirdev.uz/kurslar/dasturlash-asoslari-python/ ).
